# Introduction

Vannakam, a small introduction about myself, I am Gaurav Prasanna. Born in Chennai, yes a hardcore CSK Fan <3  but bought up in Bangalore, So I have soft corner for RCB ;). Currently work as a Data Science Engineer in ThoughtClan Technologies. I found my passion for Data Science back in 2020, during the covid time. When I was just stuck at home. I pursued my Master of Science in Data Science and Analytics in University College Cork, Ireland. 

I wanted to start a blog for primarily two aspects, first being to document my learning journey and share my knowledge with the world, and writing these concepts would even reinforce my knowledge. So happy that you have come here to read my blogs. Well among these nerdy stuff I will also occasionally write about movies and games too. I am huge fan of Cinema.

## See you on the other side!
